This plugin provides commands to browse and to manipulate (place & 
delete) marks.

:TMarks
    Browse all marks.

:{range}TMarksPlace
    Place the next available a-z mark at the specified line.

:{range}TMarksDelete
    Delete all a-z marks in range.

:TMarksDeleteAll
    Delete all a-z marks in the current buffer.

In conjunction with vimscript #2584, this plugin is similar to vimscript #152.

You might want to try wokmarks (vimscript #2522), which I personally use now.
